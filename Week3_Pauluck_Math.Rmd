### Detailed Answers:
Below are some functions that will be used for first 2 questions.
```{r}
getExpectedValue <- function(x,y) {
  return(sum(x * y))
}

getVar <- function (x, e, p){
  diff_xe_sq <- ((x*p)-e)^2
  return(sum(diff_xe_sq * p))
}

getSD <- function(x){
  return(sqrt(x))
}

buildPModel <- function(x,p){
  return(data.frame(rbind(ceiling(x), format((p),digits=2)),row.names = c("x","p_x")))
}
```

<span style="color:blue">**2.34 Card game.<br>
Consider the following card game with a well-shuffled deck of cards. If you draw a red card, you win nothing. If you get a spade,you win $5. For any club, you win $10 plus an extra $20 for the ace of clubs.**</span><br>

<span style="color:brown">(a) Create a probability model for the amount you win at this game. Also, find the expected winnings for a single game and the standard deviation of the winnings.</span>

```{r}
x <- c(0,5,10,30)
p_x <- c(26/52,13/52,12/52,1/52)
e <- getExpectedValue(x,p_x)
v <- getVar(x,e,p_x)
s <- getSD(v)

print(buildPModel(x,p_x))
sprintf("Average revenue %1.2f, variance: %1.2f, standard deviation: %1.2f", e, v,s)

```

<span style="color:brown">(b) What is the maximum amount you would be willing to pay to play this game? Explain.</span>

The maximum amount I am willing to pay is $4 which is near to the expected value.  If I play this game 100 times,
with the expected value of $4.13, I would profit $13.  
If I play this game 100 times @ $5/game, I should expect a loss of $87.


<span style="color:blue">**2.40 Baggage Fees. <br>
An airline charges the following baggage fees: $25 for the first bag and $35 for the second. Suppose 54% of passengers have no checked luggage, 34% have one piece of checked luggage and 12% have two pieces. We suppose a negligible portion of people check more than two bags.**</span>

<span style="color:brown">*(a) Build a probability model, compute the average revenue per passenger, and compute the corresponding standard deviation.*</span>

```{r}
x <- c(0,25,35)
p_x <- c(0.54,0.34, 0.12)

e <- getExpectedValue(x,p_x)
v <- getVar(x,e,p_x)
s <- getSD(v)


print(buildPModel(x,p_x))
sprintf("Average revenue per passenger %1.2f, variance: %1.2f, standard deviation: %1.2f", e, v,s)
```



<span style="color:brown">*(b) About how much revenue should the airline expect for a flight of 120 passengers? With what standard deviation? Note any assumptions you make and if you think they are justified.*</span>

```{r}
x <- c(120*.54*0, 120*.34*25,120*.12*35)

e <- getExpectedValue(x,p_x)
v <- getVar(x,e,p_x)
s <- getSD(v)
sprintf("The expected revenue should be: $%1.2f, with standard deviation of: %1.2f", e, s)

```
 
We make the assumption that the 120 passengers are random variables and none of the passengers are associated with each other.

<span style="color:blue">**2.42 Selling on Ebay.<br>
Marcie has been tracking the following two items on Ebay: A textbook that sells for an average of $110 with a standard deviation of $4 and Mario Kart for the Nintendo Wii, which sells for an average of $38 with a standard deviation of $5.**</span>


<span style="color:brown">*(a) Marcie wants to sell the video game and buy the textbook. How much net money (profits - losses) would she expect to make or spend? Also compute the standard deviation of how much she would make or spend.*</span>

```{r}
book_e <- 110
book_s <- 4
game_e <- 38
game_s <- 5
# Expected value of expenditure is: E(book - game) = E(book)-E(game)
sprintf("Marcie should expect to spend: $%1.2f", abs(110-38))
# Standard deviation: (-1)^*var(book)+(1)^2*var(game)
sprintf("With standard deviation is %1.2f. ", sqrt((book_s^2)+(game_s^2)))
```


<span style="color:brown">*(b) Lucy is selling the textbook on Ebay for a friend, and her friend is giving her a 10% commission (Lucy keeps 10% of the revenue). How much money should she expect to make? With what standard deviation?*</span>
```{r}
sprintf("Lucy should expect to make: $%1.2f, with standard deviation of: %1.2f", 0.10*book_e, sqrt(0.10^2*book_s^2))
```



<span style="color:blue">**2.46 Income and gender. <br>
The relative frequency table below displays the distribution of annual total personal income (in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars) for a representative sample of 96,420,486 Americans. These data come from the American Community Survey for 2005-2009. This sample is comprised of 59% males and 41% females.**</span>

![Distribution](C:\Users\Minnie\Desktop\income.png)

<span style="color:brown">(a) Describe the distribution of total personal income.</span><br>
The distribution appears to be symmetircal.
It is heavily concentrated in the middle, meaning majority of the population's income is between 25K-50K.

<span style="color:brown">(b) What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than $50,000 per year?</span>
  
```{r}
income <- c(2.2,4.7,15.8,18.3,21.2,13.9,5.8,8.4,9.7)*96420486/100
p_50less <-  sum(income[1:5])/(96420486)
sprintf("P(x<$50,000) is %1.2f. ", p_50less)
```

<span style="color:brown">(c) What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than $50,000 per year and is female? Note any assumptions you make.</span><br>

Assumption: propbability of person making less than 50K is independent of probability of being a female.
```{r}
p_female <- 0.41
sprintf("P(x<$50,000 and female) is %1.2f:", p_50less * p_female)
```

<span style="color:brown">(d) The same data source indicates that 71.8% of females make less than $50,000 per year. Use this value to determine whether or not the assumption you made in part (c) is valid.</span>

No, because `P(f) = 0.41` should be same as `p(f) = P(female & less than 50K)*P(50K) = (0.78)*(0.622)=0.49` <br>.
